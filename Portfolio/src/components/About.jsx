        <p>Hello there, </p>
        <p>
          I'm Vivek Kumar Khatana, a dedicated final semester undergraduate
          student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at SHOBHIT
          UNIVERSITY GANGOH. Throughout my academic journey, I've consistently
          demonstrated a passion for technology and a drive for excellence.

          My professional journey includes a valuable internship experience as a
          MERN Developer at EXOTICA IT SOLUTIONS in Mohali (Chandigarh). During
          this internship, I honed my skills in developing robust web
          applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
          stack, gaining hands-on experience in building scalable and efficient
          solutions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, I'm actively involved in tackling challenging problems on
          platforms like Code Studio, GeeksforGeeks POTD, and LeetCode's top
          interview questions. This continuous engagement allows me to sharpen
          my problem-solving abilities and stay updated with the latest industry
          trends and best practices.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition to my practical experience, my academic focus revolves
          around mastering a wide array of technologies including JavaScript,
          HTML, CSS, jQuery, React, and various other cutting-edge tools and
          frameworks. Through rigorous coursework and personal projects, I've
          developed a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
          development, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with confidence.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Looking ahead, my ultimate aspiration is to evolve into a proficient
          full-stack web developer, capable of delivering innovative solutions
          that make a meaningful impact in the digital landscape. I am eagerly
          seeking opportunities to apply my skills, contribute to dynamic
          projects, and continue my growth journey within the tech industry.
